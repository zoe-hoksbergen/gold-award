Here are my current plans:

- Research the trends of depression and anxiety in teenagers 
- Format this research into a pamphlet/short book explaining how to recognize and cope with teenage depression and anxiety, including my own experience
- Share this information to nearby highschools as well as make it available for free online (via Amazon or something similar)
